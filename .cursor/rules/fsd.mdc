## Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) Rules

1. **No inline comments**: Do not add inline comments in code. Code should be self-documenting through clear naming and structure.

2. **No barrel files**: Do not use barrel files (index.ts/index.tsx files that re-export modules). Import directly from the module file itself (e.g., `import { Component } from './Component'` instead of `import { Component } from './index'`).

3. **Use path aliases for shared imports**: Always use `@/shared` path alias instead of relative imports when importing from the shared layer (e.g., `import { formatCurrency } from '@/shared/lib/formatCurrency'` instead of `import { formatCurrency } from '../../shared/lib/formatCurrency'`).

4. **Use pnpm for package management**: Always use `pnpm` instead of `npm` for installing dependencies, running scripts, and other package management tasks (e.g., `pnpm install`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm dev`).

5. **No styling tests**: Do not write tests that verify CSS classes, styling, or visual appearance. Tests should focus on functionality, behavior, and logic, not implementation details like Tailwind classes or styling properties.
